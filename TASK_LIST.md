- [ ] Make sure that the code can run on Mac,
- [x] Find more system of ODEs with known symmetries from mathematical biology.
- [ ] Fix error of "from sympy import *" where we need to import each part of sympy individually,
- [ ] Fix so that the generator is saved with align instead of as equation,
- [ ] Decide where to publish (see the second section below),
- [x] This is how you check a box! Just and an x in the box.

- [ ] Move full calc of Hydon's model to supplementary
- [ ] Include partial example Hydon's model in example section
- [ ] Derive DBH model from symmetries
- [ ] Complete derivation of Hydon's to standard form
- [ ] Change to tau=0 everywhere in the DBH model
