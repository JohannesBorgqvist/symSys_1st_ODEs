- [ ] Fix sources for the Introduction,
- [ ] Fix sources for the Discussion,
- [ ] Shorten the code for the algorithm,
- [ ] Add a notebook in the Github,

- [ ] Find more system of ODEs with known symmetries from mathematical biology.
- [ ] Fix error of "from sympy import *" where we need to import each part of sympy individually,
- [ ] Fix so that the generator is saved with align instead of as equation,
- [x] This is how you check a box! Just and an x in the box.
