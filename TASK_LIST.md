# TASK LIST FOR THE SYM_SYS PROJECT
- [ ] Make sure code work for the general linear case,
- [ ] Make the code work for the DBH model,
- [x] Add branches github,
- [ ] Fix sources for the Introduction,
- [ ] Fix sources for the Discussion,
- [ ] Shorten the code for the algorithm,
- [ ] Add a notebook in the Github,
- [ ] Calculate the most general ODE system from the Lie algebra of the DBH model,
- [ ] Make sure that the code can run on Windows,
- [ ] Make sure that the code can run on Mac,
- [ ] Find more system of ODEs with known symmetries from mathematical biology.
- [ ] Fix error of "from sympy import *" where we need to import each part of sympy individually,
- [ ] Fix so that the generator is saved with align instead of as equation,
- [ ] Decide where to publish (see the second section below),
- [x] This is how you check a box! Just and an x in the box.



## Branches:
REALLY GOOD LINK FOR WORKING WITH BRANCHES IN GIT:
https://thenewstack.io/dont-mess-with-the-master-working-with-branches-in-git-and-github/

One branch for each participant in the project:
1. Johannes's branch,
2. Fredrik's branch,
3. Ruth's branch.
