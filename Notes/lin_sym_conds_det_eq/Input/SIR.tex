We remind ourselves that we want to study the SIR model
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \dv{S}{t}&=-rSI,\\
    \dv{I}{t}&=rSI-aI.\\
    \dv{R}{t}&=aI.\\    
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  and we are looking for a generator of the following kind:
\begin{equation}
X=\xi(t,S,I,R)\partial_t+\eta_1(t,S,I,R)\partial_S+\eta_2(t,S,I,R)\partial_I+\eta_3(t,S,I,R)\partial_R.
\end{equation}
