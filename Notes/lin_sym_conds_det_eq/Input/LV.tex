We remind ourselves that we want to study the Lotka-Volterra model:

\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \dv{u}{t}&=u(1-v),\\
    \dv{v}{t}&=\alpha v(u-1),\\    
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
and we are looking for a generator of the following kind:
\begin{equation}
X=\xi(t)\partial_t+\eta_1(t,u,v)\partial_u+\eta_2(t,u,v)\partial_v
\end{equation}
which implies that the generator is \textit{fibre preserving}. Now, derive the linearised symmetry conditions in equation \eqref{eq:lin_sym_practice} by plugging in our model in equation \eqref{eq:LV}. Given that we have autnomous reaction terms, our linearised symmetry conditions can be written as follows:

\begin{align}
a \left(u - 1\right) v \frac{\partial\eta_{1}}{\partial v} - \left(1 - v\right) \eta_{1} + \left(1 - v\right) u \frac{\partial\eta_{1}}{\partial u} - \left(1 - v\right) u \frac{d\xi}{dt} + \eta_{2} u + \frac{\partial\eta_1}{\partial t}&=0,\label{eq:LV_lin_sym_1}\\
- a \left(u - 1\right) \eta_{2} + a \left(u - 1\right) v \frac{\partial\eta_{2}}{\partial v} - a \left(u - 1\right) v \frac{d\xi}{dt} - a \eta_{1} v + \left(1 - v\right) u \frac{\partial\eta_{2}}{\partial u} + \frac{\partial\eta_2}{\partial t}&=0.\label{eq:LV_lin_sym_2}
\end{align}
These equations correspond to a coupled system of first order PDEs in two variables ($u$ and $v$) where we consider $\dd\xi/\dd t$ to be an unknown function. A property of these equations, is that they are decoupled in the sense that Equation \eqref{eq:LV_lin_sym_1} contains $\eta_2$ in only one place while Equation \eqref{eq:LV_lin_sym_2} contains $\eta_1$ in only one place. Thus, we can, for example, solve Equation \eqref{eq:LV_lin_sym_1} for $\eta_2$ and then substitute this into Equation \eqref{eq:LV_lin_sym_2}. Essentially, this will convert the system to a single PDE of order two in three variables ($t,u,v$). Using sympy as a tool for conducting the differentiations and simplifications, we will now present the results of these calculations. Equation \eqref{eq:LV_lin_sym_1} can be re-written as follows:

\begin{equation}
  \eta_{2}=- a v \frac{\partial\eta_{1}}{\partial v} + \frac{a v \frac{\partial\eta_{1}}{\partial v}}{u} - \frac{\eta_{1} v}{u} + \frac{\eta_{1}}{u} + v \frac{\partial\eta_{1}}{\partial u} - v \frac{d\xi}{dt} - \frac{\partial\eta_{1}}{\partial u} + \frac{d\xi}{dt} - \frac{\frac{\partial\eta_1}{\partial t}}{u}.\\
  \label{eq:LV_lin_sym_1_modified}
\end{equation}
Now, by substituting Equation \eqref{eq:LV_lin_sym_1_modified} into Equation \eqref{eq:LV_lin_sym_2} the following equation is obtained:
\begin{align}
  - a^{2} u^{2} v^{2} \frac{d^{2}}{d v^{2}} \eta_{1} + 2 a^{2} u v^{2} \frac{d^{2}}{d v^{2}} \eta_{1} - a^{2} v^{2} \frac{d^{2}}{d v^{2}} \eta_{1} - a \eta_{1} u v - a \eta_{1} u + a \eta_{1} + 2 a u^{2} v^{2} \frac{d^{2}}{d vd u} \eta_{1}&\nonumber\\
  - 2 a u^{2} v \frac{d^{2}}{d vd u} \eta_{1} + a u^{2} \frac{\partial\eta_{1}}{\partial u} - a u^{2} \frac{d\xi}{dt} - a u v^{2} \frac{\partial\eta_{1}}{\partial v} - 2 a u v^{2} \frac{d^{2}}{d vd u} \eta_{1} + a u v \frac{\partial\eta_{1}}{\partial v} &\nonumber\\
  + 2 a u v \frac{d^{2}}{d vd u} \eta_{1} - a u v \pdv{\eta_1}{t}{v} - a u \frac{\partial\eta_{1}}{\partial u} + a u \frac{d\xi}{dt}&\nonumber\\
  + a u \frac{\partial\eta_1}{\partial t} + 2 a v^{2} \frac{\partial\eta_{1}}{\partial v} - 2 a v \frac{\partial\eta_{1}}{\partial v} + a v \pdv{\eta_1}{t}{v}&\nonumber\\
  - a \frac{\partial\eta_1}{\partial t} - \eta_{1} v^{2} + 2 \eta_{1} v - \eta_{1} - u^{2} v^{2} \frac{d^{2}}{d u^{2}} \eta_{1} + 2 u^{2} v \frac{d^{2}}{d u^{2}} \eta_{1} - u^{2} \frac{d^{2}}{d u^{2}} \eta_{1} + u v^{2} \frac{\partial\eta_{1}}{\partial u}&\nonumber\\
  - 2 u v \frac{\partial\eta_{1}}{\partial u} + u v \pdv{\eta_1}{t}{u} + u \frac{\partial\eta_{1}}{\partial u} - u \pdv{\eta_1}{t}{u} - v \frac{\partial\eta_1}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial\eta_1}{\partial t}&=0.\label{eq:LV_lin_sym_2_modified}
\end{align}
