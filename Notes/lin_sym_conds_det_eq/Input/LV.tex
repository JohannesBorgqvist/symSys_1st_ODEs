We are looking for a generator of the following kind:
\begin{equation}
X=\xi(t,u,v)\partial_t+\eta_1(t,u,v)\partial_u+\eta_2(t,u,v)\partial_v.
\end{equation}
Now, derive the linearised symmetry conditions in equation \eqref{eq:lin_sym_practice} by plugging in our model in equation \eqref{eq:LV}. Given that we have autnomous reaction terms, our linearised symmetry conditions can be written as follows:


\begin{align}
    &\pdv{\eta_1}{t}+u(1-v)\pdv{\eta_1}{u}+\alpha v(u-1)\pdv{\eta_1}{v}\nonumber\\
    &-\left[u(1-v)\right]\left(\pdv{\xi}{t}+u(1-v)\pdv{\xi}{u}+\alpha v(u-1)\pdv{\xi}{v}\right)\label{eq:LV_lin_sym_1}\\
    &=\eta_1(1-v)-\eta_2 u,\nonumber\\
    &\pdv{\eta_2}{t}+u(1-v)\pdv{\eta_2}{u}+\alpha v(u-1)\pdv{\eta_2}{v}\nonumber\\
    &-\left[\alpha v(u-1)\right]\left(\pdv{\xi}{t}+u(1-v)\pdv{\xi}{u}+\alpha v(u-1)\pdv{\xi}{v}\right)\label{eq:LV_lin_sym_2}\\
    &=\alpha\eta_1 v+\alpha\eta_2(u-1).\nonumber
\end{align}




Now, let's expand this as much as possible and then try to derive the determining equations. Equation \eqref{eq:LV_lin_sym_1} is expanded as



\begin{align}
  \alpha u^{2} v^{2} \pdv{\xi}{v}  - \alpha u^{2} v \pdv{\xi}{v} - \alpha u v^{2} \pdv{\xi}{v} + \alpha u v \pdv{\eta_1}{v}&\nonumber\\
  + \alpha u v \pdv{\xi}{v}  - \alpha v \pdv{\eta_1}{v}  + \eta_1 v - \eta_1 + \eta_2 u &\nonumber\\
  - u^{2} v^{2} \pdv{\xi}{u}  + 2 u^{2} v \pdv{\xi}{u}  - u^{2} \pdv{\xi}{u}  - u v \pdv{\eta_1}{u}&\nonumber\\
  + u v \pdv{\xi}{t}+ u \pdv{\eta_1}{u}  - u \pdv{\xi}{t}+ \pdv{\eta_1}{t}&=0
  \end{align}
and equation \eqref{eq:LV_lin_sym_2} is expanded as follows:
