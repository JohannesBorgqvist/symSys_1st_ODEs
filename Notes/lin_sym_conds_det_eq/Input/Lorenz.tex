We remind ourselves that we want to study the SIR model
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \dv{u}{t}&=a(v-u),\\
    \dv{v}{t}&=-uw+bu-v,\\
    \dv{w}{t}&=uv-cw.
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  and we are looking for a generator of the following kind:
\begin{equation}
X=\xi(t,u,v,w)\partial_t+\eta_1(t,u,v,w)\partial_u+\eta_2(t,u,v,w)\partial_v+\eta_3(t,u,v,w)\partial_w.
\end{equation}
