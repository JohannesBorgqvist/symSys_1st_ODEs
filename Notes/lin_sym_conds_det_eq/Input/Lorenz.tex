We remind ourselves that we want to study the SIR model
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \dv{u}{t}&=a(v-u),\\
    \dv{v}{t}&=-uw+bu-v,\\
    \dv{w}{t}&=uv-cw.
    \end{split}
  \end{equation*}
  and we are looking for a generator of the following kind:
\begin{equation}
X=\xi(t,u,v,w)\partial_t+\eta_1(t,u,v,w)\partial_u+\eta_2(t,u,v,w)\partial_v+\eta_3(t,u,v,w)\partial_w.
\end{equation}
The first linearised symmetry condition is given by the following equation:

The second linearised symmetry condition is given by the following equation:

The third linearised symmetry condition is given by the following equation:
\subsection{Ans\"atze assuming that the equations for the tangents are independent of the states}
The assumption that the derivatives of the tangents are at most functions of the time $t$ amounts to finding the roots of a polynomial of the states $u$ and $v$. Since these monomials are linearly independent we obtain the following equations:

for the first linearised symmetry condition, the following equations

for the second linearised symmetry condition and the following equations

for the third linearised symmetry condition.
