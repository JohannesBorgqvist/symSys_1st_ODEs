    "# Details of the symmetry calculations for Hydon's model\n",
    "*Date:* 2021-01-19<br>\n",
    "*Written by:* Johannes Borgqvist<br>\n",
    "Here, the details of the algorithm for finding symmetries of first order systems of ODEs is presented. For the automated implementation, no details are revealed but instead all the user has to do is to provide an excel sheet where the system of ODEs is provided and then the script will try to find the symmetries using an approach based on polynomial ansätze for the tangents in the infinitesimal generator of the Lie group. However, in this automated implementation, all the details of the involved calculations are hidden from the user, and the aim of this notebook is to demonstrate these details. So let's check what is going on under the hood, and we will start by describing the model on which we will demonstrate these calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the two component system of first order ODEs which we will call \"*Hydon's model*\":\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y_{1}}{\\mathrm{d}t}&=\\frac{t y_{1} + y_{2}^{2}}{- t^{2} + y_{1} y_{2}}=\\omega_1(t,y_1,y_2),\\\\\n",
    "\\dfrac{\\mathrm{d}y_{2}}{\\mathrm{d}t}&=\\frac{t y_{2} + y_{1}^{2}}{- t^{2} + y_{1} y_{2}}=\\omega_2(t,y_1,y_2).\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the goal is to find the tangents $\\xi(t,y_1,y_2),\\;\\eta_1(t,y_1,y_2)$ and $\\eta_2(t,y_1,y_2)$ in the infinitesimal generator of the Lie group $X$ given by\n",
    "$$X=\\xi(t,y_1,y_2)\\partial_t+\\eta_1(t,y_1,y_2)\\partial_{y_1}+\\eta_2(t,y_1,y_2)\\partial_{y_2}.$$\n",
    "This is done by solving the Linearised symmetry conditions given by\n",
    "$$X^{(1)}\\left(y_i'-\\omega_1(t,y_1,y_2)\\right)=0,\\;i\\in\\left\\{1,2\\right\\}.$$\n",
    "The developed algorithm solves these conditions by plugging in a projective ansatz for the tangents into the linearised symmetry conditions. This results in a linear system of ODEs and a linear system of algebraic equations which are solved using matrix algebra. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the following set of polynomial ansätse of degree 2 for the tangents: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\xi(t,y_1,y_2)&=y_{1}^{2} \\operatorname{c_{0 1}}{\\left(t \\right)} + y_{1} y_{2} \\operatorname{c_{0 2}}{\\left(t \\right)} + y_{1} \\operatorname{c_{0 3}}{\\left(t \\right)} + y_{2}^{2} \\operatorname{c_{0 4}}{\\left(t \\right)} + y_{2} \\operatorname{c_{0 5}}{\\left(t \\right)} + \\operatorname{c_{0 0}}{\\left(t \\right)},\\\\\n",
    "\\eta_{1}(t,y_1,y_2)&=y_{1}^{2} \\operatorname{c_{1 1}}{\\left(t \\right)} + y_{1} y_{2} \\operatorname{c_{1 2}}{\\left(t \\right)} + y_{1} \\operatorname{c_{1 3}}{\\left(t \\right)} + y_{2}^{2} \\operatorname{c_{1 4}}{\\left(t \\right)} + y_{2} \\operatorname{c_{1 5}}{\\left(t \\right)} + \\operatorname{c_{1 0}}{\\left(t \\right)},\\\\\n",
    "\\eta_{2}(t,y_1,y_2)&=y_{1}^{2} \\operatorname{c_{2 1}}{\\left(t \\right)} + y_{1} y_{2} \\operatorname{c_{2 2}}{\\left(t \\right)} + y_{1} \\operatorname{c_{2 3}}{\\left(t \\right)} + y_{2}^{2} \\operatorname{c_{2 4}}{\\left(t \\right)} + y_{2} \\operatorname{c_{2 5}}{\\left(t \\right)} + \\operatorname{c_{2 0}}{\\left(t \\right)}.\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "Note here, that we have the following 18 arbitrary coefficients:\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\mathbf{c}=\\left[\\begin{matrix}\\operatorname{c_{0 0}}\\\\\\operatorname{c_{0 5}}\\\\\\operatorname{c_{0 4}}\\\\\\operatorname{c_{0 3}}\\\\\\operatorname{c_{0 2}}\\\\\\operatorname{c_{0 1}}\\\\\\operatorname{c_{1 0}}\\\\\\operatorname{c_{1 5}}\\\\\\operatorname{c_{1 4}}\\\\\\operatorname{c_{1 3}}\\\\\\operatorname{c_{1 2}}\\\\\\operatorname{c_{1 1}}\\\\\\operatorname{c_{2 0}}\\\\\\operatorname{c_{2 5}}\\\\\\operatorname{c_{2 4}}\\\\\\operatorname{c_{2 3}}\\\\\\operatorname{c_{2 2}}\\\\\\operatorname{c_{2 1}}\\end{matrix}\\right]\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "and these are all functions of the independent variable $t$. Thus, the goal is to calculate these coefficients and after plugging in these ansätze into the linearised symmetry conditions we will obtain a matrix system where these coefficients are the unknown. Before describing the details of how this matrix system is formulated and then solved, we will next include all the important Python functions that are used in the calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we want to emphasise that the details of all steps for the calculations of Hydon's model with tangential ansatze of degree 2 can be found in antoher notebook called \"*hydons_model_degree_2_all_details.ipynb*\". In this notebook, we merely present the code that you can manipulate freely. As the calculations are quite lengthy, a few bits of the code are packaged into pre-defined Python functions which are presented early on in the notebook, and all these functions as well as all code is the basis for the automated symmetry calculations that can be found in the Python scripts in the current directory.  \n"
