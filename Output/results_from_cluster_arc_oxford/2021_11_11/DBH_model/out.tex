Degree in tangential ans√§tze:	2.\\
The system of ODEs is given by:

\begin{align*}
\dv{w_{1}}{t}&=- w_{1} w_{2} - w_{1} w_{3} + w_{2} w_{3},\\
\dv{w_{2}}{t}&=- w_{1} w_{2} + w_{1} w_{3} - w_{2} w_{3},\\
\dv{w_{3}}{t}&=w_{1} w_{2} - w_{1} w_{3} - w_{2} w_{3}.\\
\end{align*}

\noindent The calculated generators are:



\noindent Some of the generators might contain the following arbitrary functions:
\begin{align*}
&\operatorname{f_{1}}\\
\end{align*}

\noindent\huge\textbf{WARNING}:\\
\noindent\Large\textit{Some of the calculated generators did not satisfy the linearised symmetry conditions. Thus, the presented list here is not complete and consists exclusively of the calculated generators that satisfy the linearised symmetry conditions.}\normalsize\\[2cm]
