# symSys_1st_ODEs
Welcome to the git repositry "*symSys_1st_ODEs*". This is a Python and LaTeX based project which conducts automated symbolic calculations of the symmetries of systems of first order ODEs using sympy.

## Description of the project
This repositry provides an automated framework for calulculating the symmetry generators for a system of ODEs. This repositry is linked to the article (**Reference to future article**).

## Pre-requisites to run the scripts
The scripts have been developed on a laptop with the following operating system:

**Ubuntu 20.10**
with the following properties:
**Kernel: Linux 5.8.0-53-generic**<br>
**Architecture: x86-64**.<br>



## Setting up the project using anaconda
The easiest way to get the scripts to work properly is to install [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). 

*conda env create -f symSys_1st_ODEs.yml*

*conda activate symSys_1st_ODEs*


*conda deactivate*
